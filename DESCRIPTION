Description: Estimation of the required sample size to develop a risk model for binary and time-to-event outcomes, based on the sample size equations proposed by Pavlou et al. (2023) <> to minimise model overfitting. The user is required to enter the anticipated values of the C-statistic and the outcome prevalence (binary outcome)  or the C-index and proportion of events at time point of interest (time-to-event outcome) and the number of candidate predictor variables. The user also needs to specify the target calibration slope which is measure of model overfitting.
