Description: Estimation of the required sample size to develop a risk model for binary outcomes, based on the sample size equations proposed by Pavlou et al. (2023) <doi:10.1177/09622802211007522>. The user is required to enter the anticipated values of the C-statistic, the outcome prevalence and the number of candidate predictor variables. The user also needs to specify the target calibration slope or the target Mean Absolute Prediction Error (MAPE).
